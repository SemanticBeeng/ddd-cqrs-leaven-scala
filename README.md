# CQRS and DDD - sample #

## Info ##
This project aims to present similar design concepts as [Leaven](https://github.com/BottegaIT/ddd-cqrs-sample) but with completely different technology stack:

HTML5 + AngularJS for web view and controllers
Twitter Bootstrap for styling
Scala-powered backend using Scalatra for REST-like API
A non-RDBMS storage type (to be decided yet)
Specs2/Scalatest for unit and integration tests
SBT for building

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd $name__snake$
$ ./sbt
> container:start
```

Now open the site's [root page](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
